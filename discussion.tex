% The Discussion should begin with a statement of the important findings of the study. Subsequent sections can address technical issues, analysis of the results, and the implications of the work. Again, it is often helpful to break down the Discussion into subsections that focus on particular topics. It is proper to include a section that summarizes and expands upon conclusions that may be drawn from the work (raises open questions, proposes future studies).

% - Summary of CLIP reward analysis
% - Limitations

When used as an additional reward to augment traditional novelty-seeking intrinsic rewards, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:intrinsic-reward}
    r_{\text{intrinsic}} = r_{\text{semantics}} + r_{\text{novelty}},
\end{equation}
it can lead to more human-like exploration i.e. curious behaviors with semantically-sound creative expression.
