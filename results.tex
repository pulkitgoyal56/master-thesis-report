% The Results of the study should be laid out in a series of declarative paragraphs. Only results essential to establish the main points of the work should be included. Often the reporting of the results can be clearer if broken down into subsections. All figures and tables must be cited in the text, and must be numbered in the order of their text citation. Figure legends should be self-explanatory, without referring to the text. They should identify the material that is being illustrated, what is shown, and its significance. Each table should be identified by number and should have a title. The Results section should not include long passages about the rationale of the experiments (which belong in the Introduction), or the methods used (which belong in the Material and Methods), nor should it include justification or discussion of the results (which belong in the Discussion section).
