When used as an additional reward to augment traditional novelty-seeking intrinsic rewards, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:intrinsic-reward}
    r_{\text{intrinsic}} = r_{\text{semantics}} + r_{\text{novelty}},
\end{equation}
it can lead to more human-like exploration i.e. curious behaviors with semantically-sound creative expression.
