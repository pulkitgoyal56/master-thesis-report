\chapter{Environments}
The following sections provide additional details about the custom environments used in our experiments.

\section{Tangram}

\section{ShapeGridWorld}
\label{sec:sgw-details}


\chapter{Flatnet}
\label{sec:flatnet}
To test the feasibility and efficacy of fine-tuning CLIP with some regularization techniques to reduce its noise for the entropy reward, we conducted some experiments on a smaller toy setup with convolutional neural networks trained as an MNIST classifier.


\chapter{Hyperparameter Tuning}
\label{sec:hyperparameters}
Here, we provide a detailed description of the hyperparameters used in our experiments.


\chapter{Materials}
\label{sec:materials}
Compute resources of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems were used for all experiments in this work.
Depending on the parameters multiple NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs were used for inference.
