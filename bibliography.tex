% All references cited in the text (and only those cited in the text) should be included. References in the text should be cited by author’s name and year of publication (Kandel, 2002, Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952, Zigmond et al., 2000a, b). Only published and “in press” (i.e., accepted for publication) references should appear in the reference list (in alphabetical order by author, then chronological order by year). A standard format of listing references looks like this: Hodgkin AL, Huxley AF (1952) The components of membrane conductance in the giant axon of Loligo. J Physiol (Lond) 116:473-496.
